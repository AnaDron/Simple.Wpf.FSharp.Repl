Simple.Wpf.FSharp.Repl
======================

A simple F# REPL engine for use in a WPF application. Mimics the F# Interactive console application inside a WPF user control. Currently based on the open source F# 3.1 Interactive process.

Currently we support the following .Net versions:

Supported versions:

	.NET framework 4.0 and higher,
	
This library will be made available as a nuget pacakge very soon - few small issues to resolve.

Example usages of the control, with styles applied dynamically, these were taken from the Wpf.TestHarness project:

### Code behind implementation

```
public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        ReplWindow.DataContext = new ReplWindowController("let ollie = 1337;;").ViewModel;
    }
}
```
XAML:
```
<v:ReplWindow x:Name="ReplWindow" />
```

### MVVM implementation

```
public sealed class MainViewModel
{
    private readonly IReplWindowController _controller;

    public MainViewModel()
    {
        _controller = new ReplWindowController("let ollie = 1337;;");
    }

    public IReplWindowViewModel Content { get { return _controller.ViewModel; } }
}
```

XAML:
```
<v:ReplWindow x:Name="ReplWindow"
              Grid.Row="1" />
```
